Sure! Here's a concise README template you can use for your Lawyers-tiptap project, covering constraints, trade-offs, and productionizing notes:

---

# Lawyers-tiptap

A rich text editor application tailored for legal documents with features such as page breaks, export to HTML, and document title management.

---

## Constraints

* **Browser-based**: Limited by browser capabilities for file export and editing.
* **ContentEditable API**: Relies on `contentEditable`, which can have inconsistencies across browsers.
* **Limited offline support**: No built-in offline editing or syncing.
* **Basic UI/UX**: Designed primarily for desktop use, not fully optimized for mobile or accessibility.
* **Single-user**: No collaboration or multi-user support yet.

---

## Trade-offs

* **Simplicity vs Feature-rich**: Focused on core editing and pagination features, avoiding complex plugins to keep the app lightweight.
* **Client-side export only**: Export to HTML is done client-side without backend processing for simplicity, but limits export options (no PDF generation yet).
* **No real-time collaboration**: Added complexity of syncing multiple users is postponed for future releases.
* **Limited security model**: No authentication or data encryption yet; intended as a starting point, not production-grade secure app.

---

## How to Productionise

* **Backend Integration**: Add a backend API for saving, versioning, and user authentication.
* **Collaboration Features**: Integrate real-time collaboration with WebSockets or services like Firebase.
* **File Exports**: Support additional export formats (PDF, DOCX) with server-side processing.
* **Offline Support**: Implement service workers and local caching for offline editing.
* **Accessibility**: Enhance UI for accessibility standards (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation).
* **Testing & CI/CD**: Add unit/integration tests, and configure CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
* **Security**: Secure user data, enable HTTPS, implement auth and role-based access controls.
* **Mobile Support**: Responsive design improvements and mobile app version.
